# CrystalsCollector Game

## Project Functionality
This is a game for web browsers where the user must match a target number by adding together up to 4 other numbers that are only revealed when images of crystals are clicked.

## Project Challenges
The main challenges of this project, and the solutions used, were as follows:
1. generate random numbers: achieved using Math.random function
2. capture user click: achieved using jQuery on click function
3. comparison of Player Score vs Target Score: achieved using if function
4. display win and loss totals: achieved by using jQuery to write values to the DOM

## Project Usefulness
This project demonstrates the applicaton of the jQuery library including content updates to the HTML file based on user behavior.

## How to get started
The game will be ready to play when the page loads. After each round is played, either the Wins or Losses value will change and the game will be ready to play again. A refresh of the page resets the Wins and Losses to zero. Other instructions are detailed on the web site.
